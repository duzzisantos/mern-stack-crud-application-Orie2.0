# Dugam - Business directory

This is a business directory yellow pages application where users can find vendors
across different merchant categories. Users can also rate vendors, send direct
messages, and connect with vendors through a social network feature - where they can
write, comment on, like, edit and delete posts. They can also report other vendors
to the application's administrator.

Users must initially sign up, and thereafter, register a business - then the account registration
process is completed. From there, they can use all the aforementioned features to browse through
the marketplace.
