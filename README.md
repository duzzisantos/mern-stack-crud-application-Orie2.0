# Dugam - Business directory

# Introduction
Orie is a business directory app that helps buyers to locate vendors in a particular city. The user filters information based on vendor categories.
There are speed dial buttons to contact the vendors either via email or telephone. This app helps to put vendors on the spotlight and customers to 
be able to make comparisons beforehand.

# User story
 # Who?
 This is targeted towards vendors and buyers at the same time.
 
 # What?
 A registration form captures vendor information - especially the salient information such as their contact details.
 The vendor wants to showcase their business online and the buyer wants to be able to contact multiple vendors, and even pre-order merchandise if possible. A
 filterable component will display vendors according to their categories.
 
 # Why?
 This fills a current need in the City of Aba, Nigeria - which has one of the highest numbers of wholesalers per capita in Nigeria, but lacks a bit of a digital
 edge when it comes to business listings.
